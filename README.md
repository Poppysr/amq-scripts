### [Avatar Dimmer](https://github.com/Poppysr/amq-scripts/blob/main/amqDimAllAvatars.user.js)
---
Left click a player's avatar while in a quiz to toggle dim on their avatar. Right click anywhere on the avatars' container to toggle dim on all the avatars in it. To adjust the dim, edit the value of dimValue. Made with 8 people in a lobby in mind, and likely breaks if used with more. The script was made to help keep track of players with guesses left in NGMC. It's my first script, feedback's welcome!
